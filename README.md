there a 2 part 1 is for handwriting 2 for training file (idk how to describe it :D) like you put a number and it will gen a number picture something like that lol
the 1 one pretty much from some one code ofc cause i'm not good in this kind of stuff (I only did this project for a lesson in college so it won't be as good as you would expect)
the data file well you have to download it cause it to big for this repos you could download it below here (it only use for 2 one so if you don't need it then you don't have to download it)
