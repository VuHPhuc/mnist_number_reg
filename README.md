# mnist_number_reg
+ "mnist_number_reg" is a project that comprises two parts. The first part focuses on handwriting, while the second part allows users to input a number (random number base on csv file size) and the system generates a corresponding number image while predicting the number. I acquired the handwriting section from someone else's code as I am not proficient in this domain. It is important to note that this project was completed for a college assignment, so its quality may not meet your expectations
+ The data file for this project is too large to be included in this repository, so you need to download it separately. You can download it from the following link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format]. Please note that there is also a separate number file, but I can't recall where I downloaded it from. You may need to search for it on your own
+ The main file is used for training the model, while the test file is used for running evaluations or testing the trained model
+ The "model-batchsize-10.keras" file is used for the number prediction, while the "model-batchsize-50.keras" file is used for the character prediction
